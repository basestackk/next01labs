# Cloudflare Wrangler Configuration

This directory is for Cloudflare Wrangler configuration files if needed.

For Cloudflare Pages deployment, you typically don't need Wrangler unless you're using:
- Cloudflare Workers
- Advanced edge functions
- Custom routing

Your Next.js app will work on Cloudflare Pages without additional configuration.
